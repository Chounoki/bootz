# Testdata

This directory contains cryptographic artifacts necessary for the Bootz implementation. The files here are included as examples only and real implementations would need their own method of generating, storing and retrieving these.

## Regenerating test data

All certificates, private keys and OVs can be regenerated by running the `generate` binary. Ensure all text files are deleted from this directory before running to avoid conflicts.

The current files in this directory were generated using the command `./generate -vendor "Cisco" -owner "Google" -serials "123A,123B"`.

### vendorca_{pub|priv}.pem

This is an x509 certificate/RSA keypair that represents the device manufacturer's root (or some intermediate) CA. This is used to sign the OVs.

### pdc_{pub|priv}.pem

This is an x509 certificate/RSA keypair that represents the owner's Pinned Domain Cert.

### oc_{priv|pub}.pem

This is an x509 certificate/RSA keypair that represents the ownership certificate. It is signed by the PDC (or in some cases is the same as the PDC).

### ov_x.txt

Each of these files are base64-encoded, PKCS7 signed messages that represent the Ownership Voucher for that control card. It is signed by the Vendor CA and contains the PDC Cert.
